AFTER LEARNING HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT 
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): This is the basic structure of a website. It uses tags to identify different types of content and their purposes on a webpage.
Each content element is enclosed within HTML tags. HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a programming language that dictates how HTML elements should appear on the front end of a webpage.
It styles the content to give the website its visual appeal, including colors, fonts, layout, and background images. CSS affects the mood and tone of a webpage,
making it an essential tool for web developers. It also enables websites to adapt to different screen sizes and device types.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a logic-based programming language used to modify website content and make it behave in different ways in response to user actions.
It adds dynamic behavior to a webpage, allowing for actions such as confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, and updating information on the fly.
JavaScript is essential for handling requests and responses on a website, storing information, and creating interactive user experiences.

In summary, HTML provides the structure, CSS styles the content, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
Together, these languages form the foundation of web development and are essential skills for anyone building websites.



TYPES CONVERSIONS IN JAVASCRIPT 
 In JavaScript, automatic type conversion occurs in many cases, where operators and functions automatically convert values to the appropriate type based on the context. For instance:
Alert Function: The alert() function automatically converts any value to a string in order to display it as a message.
Mathematical Operations: Mathematical operations typically convert values to numbers. 
For example, if you perform addition on two values, JavaScript will convert them to numbers before adding them together.
While automatic type conversion is common, there are scenarios where you might need to explicitly convert a value to a specific type, particularly when dealing with string conversion.
For string conversion, you can use the String() function explicitly. For example:

javascript
let value = 42;
let stringValue = String(value);
console.log(stringValue); // Outputs: "42"
Here, String(value) explicitly converts the number 42 to a string "42".
Explicit type conversion ensures that values are converted to the expected type, which can be crucial for proper functionality in your code.
